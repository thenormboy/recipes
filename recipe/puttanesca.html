    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 large garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 28.2-ounce can peeled tomatoes in puree with basil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Kalamata olives, halved, pitted</li>
            <li>3 anchovy fillets, chopped</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons drained capers</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>3/4 pound spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in large pot over medium heat. Add garlic 
                and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes
                with puree, olives, anchovies, capers, oregano, and 
                crushed red pepper. Simmer sauce over medium-low heat 
                until thickened, breaking up tomatoes with spoon, about 
                8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water 
                until tender but still firm to bite. Drain pasta; return to 
                same pot. Add sauce and parsley. Toss over low heat until 
                sauce coats pasta, about 3 minutes. Serve with cheese.</li>
