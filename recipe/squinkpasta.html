    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Italian dish was featured in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure 
            Part 2 when Joseph Joestar visits Italy for the first time. 
            Although he did not find the appearance of it appealing he 
            found it to be delicious. He also infused the pasta with 
            Hamon as a way to "greet" Caesar Zeppelli.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Heat oil in 
                a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until lightly 
                smoking. Add shrimp and saut√© until opaque, about 1 
                minute each side. Remove to a plate. </li>
            <li>Reheat oil and cook the scallops until they too are 
                opaque and lightly browned, 2 minutes each side. 
                Remove scallops to plate with shrimp and add garlic 
                to pan. Cook, stirring often, until golden, about 
                2 minutes. </li>
            <li>Add red pepper flakes, black pepper, salt, wine, 
                tomato, and parsley, and cook over high heat until 
                reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes. Add lemon juice 
                and butter and return seafood to the skillet, mixing 
                well. Keep warm.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta in the pot of salted water until it is al 
                dente. Drain well, return to the pot along with the 
                seafood. Toss well, and serve immediately.</li>
