    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>7 tablespoons (55 grams) all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>7 tablespoons (55 grams) cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>Sea salt, to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup dark beer, cold</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sparkling water, cold</li>
            <li>4 (7-ounce) fish fillets (thick, white fish)</li>
            <li>2 pounds potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1 quart (1 liter) vegetable oil , or lard, for frying</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Set aside 2 tablespoons of flour. In a large, roomy bowl, 
                mix the remaining flour with the cornstarch and baking 
                powder. Season lightly with a tiny pinch of salt and 
                pepper.</li>
            <li>Using a fork to whisk continuously, add the beer and 
                the sparkling water to the flour mixture and continue 
                mixing until you have a thick, smooth batter. Place the 
                batter in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into a little less than 
                1/2-inch-thick slices, then slice these into 1/2-inch-wide 
                chips. Place the chips into a colander and rinse under 
                cold running water.</li>
            <li>Place the washed chips into a pan of cold water. Bring 
                to a gentle boil and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain carefully through a colander, then dry with paper 
                towels. Keep in the fridge covered with paper towels 
                until needed.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, lay the fish fillets on a paper towel and pat 
                dry. Season lightly with a little sea salt.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil to 350 F in a deep-fat fryer or large, 
                deep saucepan. Cook the chips a few handfuls at a time 
                in the oil for about 2 minutes. Do not brown them. Once
                the chips are slightly cooked, remove them from the oil 
                and drain. Keep to one side.</li>
            <li>Place the 2 tablespoons of flour reserved from the batter 
                mix into a shallow bowl. Toss each fish fillet in the 
                flour and shake off any excess.</li>
            <li>Dip into the batter, coating the entire fillet.</li>
            <li>Check that the oil temperature is still 350 F. Carefully 
                lower each fillet into the hot oil. Fry for approximately 
                8 minutes, or until the batter is crisp and golden, 
                turning the fillets from time to time with a large slotted 
                spoon.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the fillets from the hot oil and 
                drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt. Cover with 
                greaseproof paper (parchment paper) and keep hot.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil to 400 F, then cook the chips until 
                golden and crisp, or about 5 minutes. Remove from the 
                oil and drain. Season with salt.
