            <li>To make the mayonnaise, blend the mayonnaise ingredients 
                together, reserving the oils.</li>
            <li>Once it's thoroughly combined, 
                slowly whisk in about a half cup of olive oil and a few 
                tbsp avocado oil until it reaches the desired consistency. 
                Season to taste.</li>
            <li>Mix together the cantaloupe, cherry tomatoes and basil 
                in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Smear on a medium-thin layer of the homemade mayonnaise 
                onto a slice of crustless thin white bread and top with 
                the prosciutto and the cantaloupe mixture.</li>
            <li>Add a few cranks of freshly cracked black pepper. Finally,
                add a thin smear of the mayonnaise to the top slice of 
                bread and place it on top.</li>
            <li>Slice the sandwich diagonally from corner to corner to 
                create two triangles.</li>
