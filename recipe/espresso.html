    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>An espresso is a method in which to brew coffee and can be done
            with or without an espresso machine. The espresso is shown 
            several times in Part 2 when Joseph is in Italy, and a coffee
            variation called the Americano which uses espresso shots was 
            even shown when Joseph was in America.
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>18 to 20g medium to dark roasted beans</li>
            <li><strong>Filtered Water</strong></li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps using an espresso machine..</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn on your espresso machine and give it time to warm up. </li>
            <li>Once your machine is heated and you're ready to start 
                brewing, place your portafilter on the scale and tare 
                out the weight.</li>
            <li>Grind the coffee into your portafilter until you reach
                 your desired weight, 18 to 20g for a double shot.</li>
            <li>Even out the bed of coffee in your portafiliter, 
                either through a distribution tool or with your 
                index finger. The goal is to make sure the coffee is 
                level and evenly distributed across the whole basket. </li>
            <li>Use your tamper to compress your coffee down with a 
                fair amount of pressure. It's very important that you 
                tamp straight down in order to achieve an even puck. 
                If you tamp at an angle, the extraction of your coffee
                 will be compromised.</li>
            <li>Pull your shot and taste your coffee and determine if 
                you need to change any variables to improve the 
                quality of your cup. </li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Steps without an espresso machine (french press required btw tho..)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil one cup of water.</li>
            <li>While you wait for the water to heat up, add two 
                tablespoons of freshly, finely ground coffee to your 
                French press. </li>
            <li>Add a bit of the boiling water to the French press and
                 stir briefly. </li>
            <li>Wait four minutes, then slowly push down the plunger, 
                pausing every few seconds until its all out. Note that 
                it'll be slightly challenging to push the plunger 
                down due to the grind size. </li>
        </ol>
